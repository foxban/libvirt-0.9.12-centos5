         LibVirt : simple API for virtualization

  Libvirt is a C toolkit to interact with the virtualization capabilities
of recent versions of Linux (and other OSes). It is free software
available under the GNU Lesser General Public License. Virtualization of
the Linux Operating System means the ability to run multiple instances of
Operating Systems concurrently on a single hardware system where the basic
resources are driven by a Linux instance. The library aim at providing
long term stable C API initially for the Xen paravirtualization but
should be able to integrate other virtualization mechanisms if needed.

==========================================================================

This fork of libvirt is used to adapt to my company's use case.

The main modifications to source code are as follows:

1. commented out libblkid-devel, working around for depency check.
2. add header files include to src/util/virnetlink.h, fixing compiling issue.
3. commented out docs for "libvirt-virterror.html", fixing docs validating issue.

I also made lots of modifications to libvirt.spec
